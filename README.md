Breast Cancer predict Model

Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant.

bengin tumor: benign tumor is an abnormal but noncancerous collection of cells. It can form anywhere on or in your body when cells multiply more than they should or don't die when they should. A benign tumor is not malignant. It grows more slowly, has even borders and doesn't spread to other parts of your body.

Malignant tumor: Malignant tumors have cells that grow uncontrollably and spread locally and/or to distant sites. Malignant tumors are cancerous (ie, they invade other sites). They spread to distant sites via the bloodstream or the lymphatic system. This spread is called metastasis.



Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
